# totally-private-data-farm

This is a part of last year's JavaScriptmas, a free annual festive coding event hosted by the online coding school Scrimba.<br>
I decided to use the challanges as inspiration for simple coding projects.




## Day 2
 >Write a function that maps through the current data and returns a new an array of objects with only two properties: fullName and birthday. Each result in your 
array should look like this when you're done: 

```
{
  fullName: "Levent Busser", 
  birthday: "Fri Aug 20 1971"
}
```
